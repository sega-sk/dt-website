              <strong>Scope.</strong><br />
              These terms and conditions (“this agreement” or “these terms”) apply to the design, development, delivery, and hosting of a website (the “Services” and the website, the “Website”) by Dealertower (“Dealertower”) for You (“Customer”) as identified on any order agreed to by both Dealertower and Customer that incorporates these terms and conditions by reference (an “Order”).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fees.</strong><br />
              Dealertower will invoice Customer at the end of each calendar month for the fees due with respect to Dealertower’s performance of the Services. All fees on the invoice are exclusive of any taxes due. The Order may identify certain third-party software products used by Dealertower in providing the Services or otherwise necessary for Customer to access, use and enjoy the Website (“Third-Party Product”). Unless the Order expressly identifies discrete fees for Customer to use, access or enjoy a Third-Party Product, any fees related to such use, access or enjoyment are considered part of the total fees identified in the Order. The Customer will pay such fees within 30 days of receipt of an invoice, unless Customer provides with written notice that it has good faith dispute about a portion of the fees on the invoice. Customer acknowledges that by using the Website for any revenue-generating purpose, it accepts the Services as delivered.
              <br /><br />
              In instances where the Customer’s Website does not launch within 90 days of the effective date of the Order, Dealertower reserves the right to commence billing for Services on the first day of the month following this 90-day period. This billing initiation is subject to any good faith disputes regarding the reasons for the Website’s delayed launch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Customer’s Cooperation.</strong><br />
              Customer agrees to fully and timely cooperate with Dealertower in its performance of the Services. As part of its obligation to cooperate with Dealertower, Customer will ensure that it: (a) provides all information, data and documentation (each item considered “Content”) reasonably requested by Dealertower to provide the Services; and (b) that all Content provided to Dealertower is accurate and complete. Customer must also notify Dealertower in writing of any “Heightened Security Requirements” (as defined below) that are applicable to Customer’s business, the Services or the Website. For the purposes of these terms, “Heightened Security Requirements” means any safeguard, control or process required by any laws, regulations, codes, guidance from regulatory and advisory bodies (whether mandatory or not), international and national standards, and sanctions, which are applicable to the Customer relating to security of network and information systems and security breach and incident reporting requirements, which may include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (US), Cybersecurity Directive ((EU) 2016/1148) and Commission Implementing Regulation ((EU) 2018/151), all as amended or updated from time to time.
              <br /><br />
              As between the parties, Customer shall have sole control and ownership of all Content. Customer shall ensure that it has authority to provide Content to Dealertower, and to instruct or allow Dealertower to collect, access, use, disclose, communicate, transmit, reproduce, store, modify, display and otherwise process (collectively, “Process”) Content as permitted by this agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer shall ensure that all Content is obtained in compliance with applicable laws and if any Content is obtained from third parties, in compliance with applicable third party privacy policies, terms of use, and other agreements between Customer and such third parties. To the extent Content contains or constitutes personal information, Customer shall (i) provide all notices to relevant individuals (collectively, “Relevant Individuals”), and obtain all consents from Relevant Individuals, as needed for Dealertower to perform its obligations and exercise its rights hereunder, which shall each be in a form that complies with all applicable laws as well as findings, interpretation bulletins, guidance documents or fact sheets issued by applicable regulatory authorities; (ii) without limiting (i), Customer shall ensure that Relevant Individuals in Canada are notified that their personal information will be transferred and stored outside Canada and may be accessed by foreign courts, law enforcement and national security authorities; (iii) retain appropriate records of the notices and consents described in (i) and (ii), and promptly provide evidence of such notices and consents to Dealertower upon Dealertower’s request, including as needed for Dealertower to respond to any inquiry or investigation by any relevant governmental authority; (iv) provide Dealertower with only the minimum personal information required by it to perform its obligations hereunder; and (v) take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of any and all personal information provided to Dealertower. For the purpose of this agreement, “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual, including where there is a serious possibility that an individual could be identified through the use of that information, alone or in combination with other information.
